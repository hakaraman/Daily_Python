"""
Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.
For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:
"""
def median(lst):
    lst.sort()
    mid = len(lst) // 2
    return lst[mid] if len(lst) % 2 != 0 else (lst[mid] + lst[mid-1]) / 2 

lst = [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5]
for i in range(1,len(lst)):
    print(median(lst[:i]))
